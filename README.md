## <ins>Problem Statement<ins>: Identification of Different Medicinal Plants/Raw Materials through Image Processing Using Machine Learning Algorithms

# <ins> Our Solution <ins>

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust system that utilises image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify various medicinal plants and raw materials. This innovative solution aims to assist botanists, pharmacologists, and herbalists in accurately identifying and cataloguing medicinal plants and their parts for research and medicinal purposes.

Medicinal plants have been an essential source of remedies and treatments for various ailments for centuries. However, accurately identifying these plants and their components can be a challenging and time-consuming task, especially for individuals without extensive botanical knowledge. This project seeks to bridge this gap by creating a user-friendly system that leverages modern technology for plant identification.
